# CryptoClustering
In this challenge, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

# Instructions
1.) Rename the Crypto_Clustering_starter_code.ipynb file as Crypto_Clustering.ipynb.

2.) Load the crypto_market_data.csv into a DataFrame.

3.) Get the summary statistics and plot the data to see what the data looks like before proceeding.

# Prepare the Data
* Use the StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn to normalize the data from the CSV file.

* Create a DataFrame with the scaled data and set the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.

 * The first five rows of the scaled DataFrame should appear as follows:

# Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
Use the elbow method to find the best value for k using the following steps:

* Create a list with the number of k values from 1 to 11.
* Create an empty list to store the inertia values.
* Create a for loop to compute the inertia with each possible value of k.
* Create a dictionary with the data to plot the elbow curve.
* Plot a line chart with all the inertia values computed with the different values of k to visually identify the optimal value for k.
* Answer the following question in your notebook: What is the best value for k?

# Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
Use the following steps to cluster the cryptocurrencies for the best value for k on the original scaled data:
* Initialize the K-means model with the best value for k.
* Fit the K-means model using the original scaled DataFrame.
* Predict the clusters to group the cryptocurrencies using the original scaled DataFrame.
* Create a copy of the original data and add a new column with the predicted clusters.
* Create a scatter plot using hvPlot as follows

# Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
* Using the original scaled DataFrame, perform a PCA and reduce the features to three principal components.

* Retrieve the explained variance to determine how much information can be attributed to each principal component and then answer the following question in your notebook:

* What is the total explained variance of the three principal components?

* Create a new DataFrame with the PCA data and set the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.

* The first five rows of the PCA DataFrame should appear as follows:

# Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
Use the elbow method on the PCA data to find the best value for k using the following steps:

* Create a list with the number of k-values from 1 to 11.
* Create an empty list to store the inertia values.
* Create a for loop to compute the inertia with each possible value of k.
* Create a dictionary with the data to plot the Elbow curve.
* Plot a line chart with all the inertia values computed with the different values of k to visually identify the optimal value for k.
* Answer the following question in your notebook:
* What is the best value for k when using the PCA data?
* Does it differ from the best k value found using the original data?
